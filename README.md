download the commons-io-2.11 jar and upload as it in module dependecies 

The unit testing ans system testing are done in ReadTest.java under src

The Fuzzer testing is done in Fuzzer.java under src

I put Dylans code in GroupmateDylan.java under src. The tests I wrote to test Dylan code are written in GroupmateDylanTest.java under src. 
I put Jonah code in GroupJonah.java under src. The tests I wrote to test Jonah code are written in GroupJonahTest.java under src
